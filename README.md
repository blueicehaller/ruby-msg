# ruby-msg

This is an additional batch script for [ruby-msg - Google Code Archive](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ruby-msg/wikis/Home.wiki).<br>
Place it in the folder where you extracted `mapitool-1.5.0-mswin32-stand_alone`.

I found the repository [aquasync/ruby-msg: A library for reading and converting Outlook msg and pst files (mapi message stores)](https://github.com/aquasync/ruby-msg) <br>
and asked [Is this repository the successor of ruby-msg on Google Code?](https://github.com/aquasync/ruby-msg/issues/21) and the owner confirmed that.
